![Screenshot 2025-03-05 132806](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ab628bf-8f1b-4a04-8cce-1d7480a35283)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes fines imposed on European companies for violating privacy laws over a specified period. By examining trends and key events in the data, we uncover insights into regulatory enforcement and its impact on corporate behavior. One notable finding is that the highest fine spike occurred in 2019 when Google paid the highest recorded fine in history for violating European privacy laws.

## Data
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Content:** Fines data including dates, company names, violation types, and fine amounts.
- **Timeframe:** Several years, allowing trend analysis over time.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for data analysis and visualization.
- **pandas** and **numpy** for data manipulation.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for plotting trends and distributions.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive exploration.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handle missing values, correct data types, and standardize formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualize trends in fine amounts over time.
   - Segment data by violation type, industry, and company.
3. **Statistical Analysis:**  
   - Calculate key metrics (mean, median, standard deviation).
   - Identify significant spikes and trends.
4. **Findings & Reporting:**  
   - Highlight key insights, including the record-breaking fine by Google in 2019.

## Results & Insights
- **Trend Analysis:** Identified significant periods of increased fines.
- **Key Finding:** A notable spike in 2019 when Google paid the highest fine for privacy violations.
- **Segmentation:** Insights by violation type and industry help inform compliance strategies.
- **Recommendations:** Data-driven suggestions for improved corporate compliance and regulatory practices.
